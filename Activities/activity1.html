        <p>
            <strong>Verse 1</strong><br>
            Risin' up, back on the street<br>
            Did my time, took my chances<br>
            Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet<br>
            Just a man and his will to survive<br>
            So many times it happens too fast<br>
            You trade your passion for glory<br>
            Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past<br>
            You must fight just to keep them alive <br><br>

            <strong>Chorus</strong><br>
            It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
            Risin' up to the challenge of our rival<br>
            And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger <br><br>

            <strong>Verse 2</strong><br>
            Face to face, out in the heat <br>
            Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry <br>
            They stack the odds till we take to the street <br>
            For the kill with the skill to survive <br><br>

            <strong>Chorus</strong><br>
            It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight <br>
            Risin' up to the challenge of our rival <br>
            And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night <br>
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger <br><br>

            <strong>Verse 3</strong><br>
            Risin' up, straight to the top <br>
            Had the guts, got the glory <br>
            Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop <br>
            Just a man and his will to survive <br><br>

            <strong>Chorus</strong><br>
            It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight <br>
            Risin' up to the challenge of our rival <br>
            And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night <br>
            And he's watching us all with the eye<br>
            Of the tiger <br><br>

            <strong>Outro</strong><br>
            The eye of the tiger <br>
            The eye of the tiger <br>
            The eye of the tiger <br>
            The eye of the tiger <br>
